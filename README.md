# CSS + JS Clock

Second challenge from Wes Bos's [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/).

My modifications:
- Made use of the Monokai color
- Added ticks to the clock face
- Different lengths and widths for the hands
- Solved the transition problem when time value changes to `0` by setting `transition-duration` to `0s` and back to original (`0.01s`)
